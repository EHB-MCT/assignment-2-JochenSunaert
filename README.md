## Description

WeatherScraper automates the collection of weather forecast data from weather.com using Puppeteer. It saves the scraped data in a MongoDB database, making it accessible for further processing, aggregation, or visualization. This project demonstrates efficient data management and clean code organization to ensure scalability and maintainability.

---

## Features

- **Automated Weather Forecast Scraping**: Extracts temperature, weather conditions, precipitation, wind speed, and day of the week.
- **Database Integration**: Stores weather data in MongoDB using a well-defined Mongoose schema.
- **Reusable Modules**: Modular and reusable code to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- **Configuration-Driven**: Leverages configuration files for flexible app settings and environment management.
- **Future-Ready**: Designed for future integration with data visualization and dynamic updates.

---

## Technologies

- **Scraping**: [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)
- **Backend**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- **Environment Management**: `.env` for sensitive information and `config` for app settings

## File Structure

```
/WeatherScraper
  /config
    default.json
  /database
    connectDB.js
    saveWeatherData.js
  /models
    weatherData.js
  /scraping
    getWeatherData.js
    scrapeWeatherData.js
    extractWeatherData.js
  /utils

```

- **/config**: Stores configuration files for app settings (e.g., app name, port).
- **/database**: Contains utility scripts for database connection and data storage.
- **/models**: Includes the Mongoose schema for weather data.
- **/scraping**: Manages all scraping logic and data extraction modules.
- **/utils**: Contains helper functions (e.g., `formatDate.js`).
- **index.js**: The main entry point for the application.

## Configuration

### App Configuration
Located in `/config/default.json`:
```json
{
  "appName": "WeatherScraper",
  "port": 3000
}
```

### Environment Variables
Defined in a `.env` file:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/weatherData
```

Ensure sensitive credentials are not pushed to version control by including `.env` in `.gitignore`.

---

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start the application**:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

3. **Output**: The scraper will extract weather data and save it in MongoDB.

---

## Roadmap

- [x] Develop basic scraper with Puppeteer
- [x] Integrate MongoDB for data storage
- [ ] Implement data validation and aggregation endpoints
- [ ] Add data visualization capabilities
